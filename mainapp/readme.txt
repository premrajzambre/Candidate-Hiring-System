It is for importing csv into postgresql databse using cutom command of Django.
I made directry mainapp/management/commands/importmydata.py
So whwnver you want to import some csv data to the applicant database use 'python manage.py importmydata' to run the script.
before that update the path of csv file in importmydata.py file.
